# Python Dojo: Slider Game

This game was created at the September CodeHub Python Dojo.

The aim was to create a [slider puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle).

Our game is played from the command line with the controls "wasd" for sliding tiles.

Numberphile has [a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1WqYKHi78) as to why all board arrangements are not solvable.
